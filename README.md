# Weather-Dashboard

I was employed to create a website which can show the 5 day weather forecast for any city in the world. To enable travelers to plan their trips. 

## The Goal

The objective was to present a 5 day weather forecast of a user defined City

The important aspects were:

    - The current date at the top of the page,
    - Colour coded timeblocks for the work day, seperating past, present and future,
    - User input into the description field,
    - Access to the data should they refresh the page.
